images and fonts are not gzipped. 

When bundling to dist/about/about.html the url in the browser will be:
https://cwp-96138d828021.herokuapp.com/work/work-overview.html

can maybe extract config file parser, error, and log into a CLI util library of some sort?

font paths aren't 100% for nested files. But they still seem to resolve?
